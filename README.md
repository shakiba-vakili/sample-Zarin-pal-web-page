## About

[ZarinPal](https://shakiba-vakili.github.io/sample-Zarin-pal-web-page/) stands as a beacon of innovation in the Iranian startup scene, celebrated for its minimalist yet striking website design. While not the original developer, I embarked on this project as part of an HTML & CSS course in Iran, striving to capture the essence of ZarinPal's ethos. The result? A fully responsive webpage that mirrors the sophistication and simplicity ZarinPal is renowned for.
